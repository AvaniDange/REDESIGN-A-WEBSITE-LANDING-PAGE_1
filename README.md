## PROJECT OVERVIEW

This UI/UX task involves redesigning the landing page of **Food.com** to enhance **usability** and **visual appeal**, with a focus on creating a seamless and enjoyable recipe-browsing experience.

For **Food.com**, the redesign includes the following updates:  

### Key Improvements:  
1. **Simplified Navigation**:  
   - The overcrowded taskbar titles have been replaced with a **dropdown menu** structure to declutter the interface.  
   - This change improves the user's ability to navigate to different pages intuitively and efficiently.

2. **Compact Design**:  
   - The **size of the homepage** has been reduced to focus on key elements and minimize distractions.  
   - This compact layout ensures that users can quickly find the most relevant recipes and features.  

3. **Enhanced Visuals**:  
   - A **new color scheme** was introduced to create a visually cohesive and modern design.  
   - The updated palette enhances readability and aligns better with the website's theme.

### Deliverables:  
1. **Before-and-After Visuals**: A comparison of the current Food.com landing page and the redesigned version.  
2. **Design Decisions**:  
   - Dropdown menus make navigation smoother and less overwhelming.  
   - A reduced homepage size optimizes content focus and accessibility.  
   - The refined color scheme ensures aesthetic consistency and improves user engagement.  

These changes aim to streamline user interactions and make the browsing experience more intuitive and enjoyable.
